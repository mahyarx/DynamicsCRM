# DynamicsCRM
Microsoft Dynamic CRM API Endpoint

To use Microsoft Dynamic CRM API
There we have python Code in 3 different Version:
First we need to run python as web service, then we can send Data to this web service, by any programming Language like PHP or even Simple JavaScript code, then here we have an API Endpoint for Microsoft Dynamic CRM.
Why python: as in PHP it’s hard to deploy NTLM specially for Dynamic CRM there is many incompatibilities but in Python simply with a few line and “requests_ntlm” library possible to deploy it, that’s why I chose Python.
There we have an example as “form.html”
After run webserver, open this form and send information to add new

to run:
python api3.py 9999
